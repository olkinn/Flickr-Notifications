# Flickr-Notifications
A basic node js application, which sends desktop notifications when your photo on flickr.com gets a new comment or a new favorite.

# Installation
Clone this repo. Run "npm install".
Make sure you have node installed!
Set your environment variables "process.env.FLICKR_API_KEY" to your flickr api key (you can get it at https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html) and "process.env.FLICKR_USER_ID" to your flickr user id.

#Usage
Then in the project folder just do "node index.js".
